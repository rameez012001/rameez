    "Still figuring things out, sometimes getting it right, sometimes falling headfirst into pits I didn’t see coming. It ain’t perfect—just late-night thoughts, half-baked plans, and little wins that keep you going. Somewhere in all that chaos and push, I’m just out here trying to make sense of the mess. \nI’m curious about a lot of things—tech, people, tragedies, why we think the way we do, how power works, history, languages, and even random stuff like the math behind games, game theories or how our surroundings shape us. I like pulling at loose threads just to see where they lead, whether it’s a scene from a show or a small detail in everyday life. It’s not about knowing everything, just about connecting the dots bit by bit and paying a little more attention to the patterns along the way.",

    " When I look back at the things I started building after learning web development, it feels so lame that I did so little yet considered myself something more. I didn’t even know how to position an element, and my work would get rejected every time I uploaded it to Frontend Mentor. And to be able to refactor webpages and develop templates from designs is what makes me realize how far I’ve come. I know I still have a lot more to learn.",

  reads:
    " Not an avid reader, but a real page-turner can definitely make me one. I used to read romance novels because they give me an experience simply by consuming them. Self-help books are BS, but they can be great starters for amateurs or wannabes since they give an idea of what one could be and also easy to read because they’re full of points and anecdotes. I don’t know where this obsession with tragedies came from, but it pulls me toward classics.",
