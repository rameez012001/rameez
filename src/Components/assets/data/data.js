    "Still figuring things out, sometimes getting it right, sometimes falling headfirst into pits I didn’t see coming. It ain’t perfect—just late-night thoughts, half-baked plans, and little wins that keep you going. Somewhere in all that chaos and push, I’m just out here trying to make sense of the mess. \nI’m curious about a lot of things—tech, people, tragedies, why we think the way we do, how power works, history, languages, and even random stuff like the math behind games, game theories or how our surroundings shape us. I like pulling at loose threads just to see where they lead, whether it’s a scene from a show or a small detail in everyday life. It’s not about knowing everything, just about connecting the dots bit by bit and paying a little more attention to the patterns along the way.",

  projects:
    " During quarantine, started by building static sites and uploading them to Frontend Mentor for feedback, to learning JavaScript and eventually React. The first project was with friends, turning web template into its React version. Later, joined them in creating web templates. Difficulties with pixel-perfect designs caused some projects slipped by, but before I left I finally pulled it off.",

  reads:
    " Never used to read but somehow began with self-help books — simple, easy to follow, full on points on how to be better, but never acted on it. I then read romance novels —romance experienced through fiction— and a few good ones pulled me into reading, would say I more of a seasonal reader. Later I moved on to crime thrillers and classics.",
