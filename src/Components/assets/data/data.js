export const about = "Still figuring things out, sometimes getting it right, sometimes falling headfirst into pits I didn’t see coming. It ain’t perfect—just late-night thoughts, half-baked plans, and little wins that keep you going. Somewhere in all that chaos and push, I’m just out here trying to make sense of the mess. \nI’m curious about a lot of things—tech, people, why we think the way we do, how power works, history, languages, and even random stuff like the math behind games or how our surroundings shape us. I like pulling at loose threads just to see where they lead, whether it’s a scene from a show or a small detail in everyday life. It’s not about knowing everything, just about connecting the dots bit by bit and paying a little more attention to the patterns along the way."
