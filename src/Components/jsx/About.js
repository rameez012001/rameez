            Still figuring things out, sometimes getting it right, sometimes
            falling headfirst into pits I didn’t see coming. It’s not all
            perfect; it’s the usual mix of late-night thoughts, half-baked
            plans, and small wins that keep you moving. Somewhere between the
            mess and the momentum, I’m just trying to make sense of it all.

            I’m curious about a lot of things—tech, people, why we think the way
            we do, how power works, history, languages, and even random stuff
            like the math behind games or how our surroundings shape us. I like
            pulling at loose threads just to see where they lead, whether it’s a
            scene from a show or a small detail in everyday life. It’s not about
            knowing everything, just about connecting the dots bit by bit and
            paying a little more attention to the patterns along the way.
