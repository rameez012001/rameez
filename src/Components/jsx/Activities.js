            Only started reading books in the summer after finishing school.
            Mostly sticked to romance novels, as they satisfied what I was not
            experiencing. Over time, I began exploring other genres by browsing
            Amazon for books with above-average reviews and high ratings. Thatâ€™s
            how I discovered my first crime thrillers, which kept me hooked, and
            classics.
