        </div>
        <div className="content">
          <p className="paragraph">
            You are the product of a universe that does not know you exist. From
            the chaotic quantum foam at the beginning of time to the molecular
            accidents that sparked life, every part of your existence is a
            statistical exception—neither necessary nor impossible. There was no
            no blueprint, no guiding hand. The atoms that make you once belonged
            to stars and dust. They assembled not with intention but with
            probability. You are, simply, what happened.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            This realization dismantles the human craving for destiny. Destiny
            suggests a path designed in advance, an endpoint waiting to be
            reached. But the universe does not write stories. It does not care.
            Everything that exists does so because conditions allowed it, not
            because it was meant to be. The laws of physics govern interaction,
            and randomness shapes outcomes. Cause and effect operate without
            motive.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            Still, the illusion of destiny persists, especially in moments of
            intense emotional connection. When you meet someone who feels
            familiar—as if you’ve known them across lifetimes—it feels like
            fate. But what you’re experiencing is not prophecy. It is pattern
            recognition. Your mind, shaped by evolution to find meaning and
            connection, projects archetypes onto reality. Faces, voices,
            gestures, fragments of memory and desire—these combine into a
            powerful internal illusion: that this person was always meant to
            appear. In truth, they fit an internal model sculpted by your
            history, pain, and longing. They were not written in the stars. They
            were proximate and accessible.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            The Uncertainty Principle—first meant for particles—extends to your
            life. You cannot trace all forces that shaped you, too vast to trace
            and too chaotic to calculate. You cannot predict where you'll be and
            who you’ll become with perfect precision. Too many variables. Too
            much noise. We are the macro-scale embodiment of that uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            To accept this is is liberation. Without destiny, there is no burden
            to fulfill an imagined purpose. Without fate, there is no betrayal
            when life diverges. Meaning is not given. It is made.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            You are not here for a reason. You are here despite every reason not
            to be.
